# deeplearning-income-classification

1. Project Description
•	Goal of the project is to develop a functional model for classifying income bracket during deep learning utilizing PyTorch
•	Using manual methods for preprocessing, feature extraction, feature engineering, model development to learn the ins/outs of PyTorch
2. Features
•	Determining relevant and irrelevant features
•	Applied either label encoder or one-hot encoding to applicable features and label
4. Usage
•	Upload your data and load into the model, pulling from github is the easiest, and replace 'url=xxxx' with your raw data
•	Run through the commands for text preprocessing, converting data to Tensors, training/validation, then finally testing on separate dataset
5. Data
•	Obtained from UMSL
•	Contains over 25k samples
•	The data was preprocessed to remove stop words, special characters, normalize text, handle missing values, etc.
7. Model Details
•	This model uses all manual calculation to run through the process initializing a neural network to the final output and metric analysis
8. Evaluation - WIP
•	Requires higher quality data for refinement
•	Current score are apt for research/training purposes
9. License
•	This project uses PyTorch
